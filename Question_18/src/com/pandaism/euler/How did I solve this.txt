A. Not knowing where to start beside:
1. The triangle can possibly be a matrix
2. I can brute force (not advised) or use a binary search tree
3. Question 67 will be the same question but longer so I should find a quicker method now
4. The result for the highest iteration would be the result
     if: (left node from root) + root > (right node from root) + root
     then: (left node from root) += root
     else: (right node from root) += root

B. Beside the above, I did some research to figure out which was the best method to approach the problem
I found:
1. It was advise that starting from the bottom would result in a quicker solution
2. It can indeed be stored in a 15x15 matrix
3. It can also be solved as a binary search tree

C. To attempt to solve the problem I needed to:
1. Parse the triangle into a matrix
2. Read the matrix in reverse row order
3. To save computation time I need to store the information based from A.4 into the matrix
4. The largest sum will be the largest value in row 0 of the matrix
