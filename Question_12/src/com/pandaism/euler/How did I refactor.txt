The square of a number is n * n.
Using this knowledge the square root of a number is n.
Hence:
    The divisor of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
    The divisor of Math.sqrt(16) or 4: 1, 2, 4

The divisor of 4 is approximately 1/2 of the divisor of 16. Using this it can be used to approximate this divisor
of a large triangle number.
