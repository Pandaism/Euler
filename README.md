# Euler
Modules for the currently completely Euler Problems from ProjectEuler

Completed 25/626 | Skipped:

For questions I deemed difficult I have a txt within the module with my thought process of how I went about to solving
the question. Time spent away from solving the problem was not calculated in due to the reason: "A river always flows,
just because you stop rowing does not mean the river stop flowing." - Unknown
